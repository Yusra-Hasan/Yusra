## Global climatic concerns

Transportation contributes upto a quarter of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE). The combustion of fossil fuels in traditional internal combustion engines (ICEs) releases carbon dioxide CO2  into the atmosphere which contributes majorly to the global warming.

According to an estimate by the International Energy Agency (IEA) the global carbon dioxide emissions emanating from the combustion of fossil fuel would rise from 31.2 gigatons (Gt) in 2011 to 37.0 Gt in 2035 if the existing policy commitments are executed in future 1. Whereas, the emissions will decline steadily to 30.5 Gt in 2035 after reaching its peak at 32.4 Gt in 2020 in the Efficient World Scenario 1. The Efficient World Scenario takes into consideration of execution of all energy efficient investment and adoption of policies that promote energy efficient market scenario.

Of the total emissions, the electricity and heat sector accounts for 50.14% and the transport sector accounts for 22.43 % of the total global emissions 1. As far as electricity and heat sector is concerned, most countries have a stable structure towards energy generation. However, transport sector can contribute to reduction of CO2 emissions significantly not only in the transport sector only but also in the energy sector by increasing the proportion of non-fossil fuel energy.

EV’s meet the societal urgency to decarbonize the planet


The intense damaging effect that the traditional vehicles cause to the climate has raised concerns all over the world.  EV’s have emerged as a key technology in the quest for decarbonization or reducing CO2 emissions from the transportation sector. 

### Electric Vehicles assist in reduction of GGE in multiple ways primarily. 

1. The production and distribution of fuels which is used by the gas powered vehicles leads to generation of carbon emissions. Since EV’s use electricity which can be generated from renewable sources such as solar, wind and water their use can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions typically associated with fossil fuels. 
2.	he combustion of traditional fuels releases Green House Gas emission.  EV’s emit zero tailpipe emissions, thus acting as a major contributor in reducing the total emissions generated by the transport sector.
3.	Electric vehicles are more energy-efficient than their fossil fuel based counterpart. They convert a higher percentage of the energy stored in their battery to power the wheels, resulting in less overall energy consumption and lower emissions. 


However, the environmental benefits of electric cars depend on the energy sources used to produce the electricity. If the electricity is primarily generated from fossil fuels, the carbon emissions reduction would be minimal. Therefore, it's important to focus on increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. This reduces dependence on fossil fuels and helps to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation. Further, electric car batteries need to be properly recycled. Without proper recycling programs in place, the environmental benefits of electric cars could be offset by the negative impact of improper battery disposal.

## Understanding the cost trend in adoption of EV’s

Adoption of EV technology involves electricity generation and setting up of battery plants that comes at a higher cost. This increases the initial sales price of EV’s. Although EV’s are cheaper to run and maintain than the gasoline counterparts, an average consumer is hesitant to make investment in a technology which does not bring much benefit to him in the short run.










The cost will decrease as the configurations are made simpler and increase in production brings economies of scale. The global EV production increased from more than 1.7 to 7.3 million units from the year 2019 to 2022 3.  As a greater number of EV’s proliferate into the market, the competition will increase thus further driving down the overall cost. Further, widespread research and innovations will also bring improvement in technologies, bringing the overall cost down. It is expected that the overall volume of EV’s will be at par with Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)  by 2025.

## Meeting the infrastructure barriers

While EV’s are the future of energy and transport sector, the right infrastructure is an indispensable necessity to eliminate reluctance from its adoption by the consumers. According to Volvo study 50% of the potential buyers are reluctant to buy EV due to the lack of robust charging infrastructure 4. Also, more than 55% of the potential drivers claim that range anxiety and fear of running out of the fuel is keeping them away from buying EV’s 4.  However, once they shift their preference to an an EV, it is rare chance for them to shift their preference to an ICE vehicle.

Several companies have ambitious plans towards EV adoption. Lyft is all set to join Amazon and UPS in converting its entire fleet to EV. Ryder Trucks and ABB have partnered with In-charge to convert their fleets to EV. Tesla is already holding over 650,000 cybertruck reservations. One of the bolder moves by Volvo is to end its gas powered vehicles by 2025. Ford is all set to announce its Electric Vehicle Centre.

This kind of mass adoption requires a suitable infrastructure to upgrade the industry trend. The battery charging units, the must need of an EV infrastructure, need to be sufficiently made available. The businesses ought to take a leap to make the charging facilities available to attract more visitors. The hospitality industry, the retail industry, the workplaces require an upgrade in their electrical infrastructure in their buildings to upgrade the industry.

Governments need to partner with innovative companies and invest in building more public and private charging stations to increase accessibility for EV owners. According to an estimate, 2.8 million public charge points and 2.4 million private charge points will be needed in Europe by 2030. In USA 1.1 million public charge points will be needed by 2030 5 This will encourage more people to switch to EVs without worrying about running out of battery power. Battery swapping stations where depleted battery can be exchanged for the new ones can also be a novel idea for longer travels. Grid expansion and enhancement also requires coordinated plans to ensure that EV’s become a source of grid stability rather than pose a challenge. Overall, they will lead to multi value generation by bringing energy efficiency and affordable mobility.

Overall, overcoming infrastructure barriers for the adoption of EVs will require a collaborative effort between governments, private companies, and local communities. By investing in charging infrastructure and providing financial incentives, EVs can become more accessible and affordable for everyone, leading to a cleaner and more sustainable future.

## Current market share and projected market share in major markets

The past five years have seen a significant rise in adoption of EV’s in all the major markets. Not only drivers are buying EV’s at a significantly increasing pace, bus and truck segments are taking over the EV market scenario specially as the prices become highly competitive in comparison with the alternative gasoline. 
EV sales doubled in 2021 and jumped to 55% in 2022 accounting to 13 % of all vehicle sales. In 2022 market share is highest in China at 27%  followed by Europe at 20% and the United States with 7% 6.

According to a forecast project, global EV volumes are projected to grow at a 22% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2035. China and Europe will be leading in production with China accounting for approximately 75% of vehicle production while Europe will account for 76% of vehicle production. North America is projected to adopt EV’s at 58% in 2035 6.

## Main policy drivers of the EV adoption

China, Europe and United States are the biggest drivers in undertaking policy measures and mandates to spur up the EV sale numbers. Numerous fiscal incentives have been given by countries to boost up the EV manufacturing and battery industries. The primary being purchase subsidies and tax rebate for purchase or registration of battery powered vehicles. Other method includes mandate set by jurisdictions requiring certain percentage of the total sales to be that of EV. Charging infrastructure has simultaneously got due support by the government either by direct investment setting up charging stations at public places or incentives given to homeowners for setting up their own charging points.

### China

China has received massive encouragement from government and general public towards adoption of EV’s owing to the huge level of pollution. Shanghai had the world’s first fleet of fully electric vehicles in 2010 during the World EXPO. These buses were used to drive passengers to and fro.  Since then, there has been a continuous rise of EV’s, and a good number of measures have been taken to encourage EV adoption.  

China has set the goal of having 40 % of the EV vehicles out of the total vehicles sold 7.  Government has poured millions of Yuan as a subsidy to encourage adoption of EV’s in the year 2009. The subsidy was supposed to phase out by the year 2020, although it was extended due to covid. A mandate was imposed by the government on the auto makers that a certain percentage of the total cars manufactured by them should be battery powered. The manufacturers must earn a certain number of points to produce EV’s based on range, energy efficiency and overall performance. According to William H. Green, the Hoyt C. Hottel Professor in Chemical Engineering. “This is one of the strongest mandates for electric cars worldwide, and it’s being imposed on the largest car market in the world”.   

China is also in the process of ending the sale of fossil fuel cars in urban areas of the tropical island in China by 2030. The success of this goal can provide a blueprint for the entire country. The island has more than 75,000 charging points with EV owners not more than a mile or two away from the power station 7. 


### Europe

Europe showed continued growth upto 65% after the 2020 boom 8.  The largest market in Europe remains Germany where EV sales accounted for 25 % of the total car sales 8. Germany has set a goal of having 10 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 and has introduced highest subsidy programs in the Europe. The highest market share for new electric car sales in Europe in the year 2021 are Norway 86%, Iceland 72%, Sweden 43% and the Netherlands 30%, France 19%, Italy 9% and Spain 8% 8. The spread of cars on European road is evenly divided between the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) unlike China where BEV takes a clear lead. PHEV buys are more attractive given the offerings by automakers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Many European governments come up with their innovative tax break programs, subsidies and special privileges. Norway offers a generous subsidy package of EUR 17000 on purchase of EV in comparison to on purchase of an ICE 9.  A one-time premium ranging from GPB 4000-7000 (depending on the price of vehicle) is also paid by the government of the United Kingdom (UK) on all the vehicles emitting less than 75 gm/km 9. Purchase tax, lease tax and road tax are being eased by the government to encourage EV purchases. Preferred parking, special driving lanes and toll fee waiver are some other incentives to encourage EV adoption. In Paris, preferred parking is available to EV drivers. Oslo allows the EV car drivers to drive in bus and taxi lanes 9. 

Many governments are making investments towards EV support infrastructure like charging stations and special parking spots. Estonia for example installed 165 fast chargers throughout the country 9. The government has been dedicating funds towards research and development and mobility programs. 

### United States

The United States showed an uptick in EV sales in 2021 after two years of consecutive of 10%. 10. with California being the state with the highest number of electric vehicle sales. The sale of BEVs also reached a relatively higher percentage in comparison with PHEVs. 

The government has offered incentives such as rebates to encourage EV ownership by offsetting the total upfront cost of the EV’s. The country has several states that have implemented zero emission vehicle program (ZEV) under which the auto makers are required to produce a certain number of battery electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The laws which ban the sale of vehicles powered by gas by 2035 have also been brought into effect. The Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022 also allows for credit available upto $7500 for the purchase of EV’s upto 2035 11. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in 2021, aims to allocate $7.5 Billion towards building of infrastructure necessary for EV charging 11. The legislation not only included charging stations but also upgrading of the power grid to accommodate the demand of the growing electricity towards battery required by EV’s.

The automakers are investing billions of dollars towards EV oriented research and development. They have plans to come out with a greater number of models offering the consumers a wider choice. Also, most of the automakers are aiming to end production of gas-powered vehicles in future. The major player in US is Tesla which accounts for over half of the units sold.

## Conclusion

Transportation is one of the major contributors to generation of global CO2 emissions.  However, if key-points from the report by International Energy Agency (IEA) are to be considered, this rate of emission will decline in a ideal world scenario. EV’s are an indispensable necessity for effective execution of plans and policies to reach an ideal world scenario. Ever since the introduction of EV’s in the wake of addressing global climatic concerns EV’s have been on a continual rise. Several incentives and ambitious plans and mandates with China, Europe and USA leading the way. There’s been a compelling shift in consumer demand considering EV’s as a better proposition. Given the programs and policies and the drive by automakers and consumers,  it is expected that EV’s will be at par with ICE by the year 2025.
